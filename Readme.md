## Introduction

During the last two weeks I spent at The Tech Academy, I worked with a team developing an interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company. This content management service was designed in mind for users who aren't technically saavy, so ease-of-use was a priority. The site has just been started, so there were many improvements that could be made. Our team was comprised of people of varying skill-levels and the user-stories available reflected that. I saw this as an opportunity to challenge myself and continue building upon what I've already learned. I tackled several stories, with three of them being "difficult." I found that the more challenging stories were much more enjoyable and rewarding. 

Working on this application was an opportunity to demonstrate my abilities and continue to learn new skills. 



## Full Stack Stories

#### Search Productions
I was tasked with creating a search and filter feature that would allow the user to filter Productions on the Productions Index page. 
This involved querying the database to create, filter, and sort a list that I would be able to use on the front-end. The search field
simultaneously searches different fields, and the user can select any combination of fields to further filter the data. I was challenged to improvise, adapt, and overcome obstacles that this story presented to me. I relied heavily on constant debugging to ensure that the feature was working as intended and to recognize problems as they came up.

#### Home Page
After completing two "difficult" stories, my Instructor gave me the opportunity to redesign the home page of the website. This involved mostly front-end design, but also included a little bit of back-end work. It was the end of my second sprint, but I was up to the challenge and I looked forward to providing the project with a clean and aesthetic home page. While there was no user story posted as it was already the end of my final sprint, my instructor recognized my abilities and we discussed what the homepage should look like.

#### Dynamic Archive
When I started the project, the Archive of past productions contained static content. I took on the task of making that page dyanmically generate content. We needed to query the database and display past productions by season (year range). The content needed to be displayed concisely.

## Front-end Stories

#### Responsive Rental Requests
This was a challenging user interface story to transform the Rental Request Index page of the website. We needed a responsive design, that was both professional and stylish. This was my first "difficult" story during the live project, and I wanted to create something that not only look good for the end user, but was easy to use and understand as well.
