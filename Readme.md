# Introduction

During the last two weeks I spent at The Tech Academy, I worked with a team developing an interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company. This content management service was designed in mind for users who aren't technically saavy, so ease-of-use was a priority. The site has just been started, so there were many improvements that could be made. Our team was comprised of people of varying skill-levels and the user-stories available reflected that. I saw this as an opportunity to challenge myself and continue building upon what I've already learned. I tackled several stories, with three of them being "difficult." I found that the more challenging stories were much more enjoyable and rewarding. 

Working on this application was an opportunity to demonstrate my abilities and continue to learn new skills.

### Search Productions
I was tasked with creating a search and filter feature that would allow the user to filter Productions on the Productions Index page. 
This involved querying the database to create, filter, and sort a list that I would be able to use on the front-end. The search field
simultaneously searches different fields, and the user can select any combination of fields to further filter the data. I was challenged to improvise, adapt, and overcome obstacles that this story presented to me. I relied heavily on constant debugging to ensure that the feature was working as intended and to recognize problems as they came up.
